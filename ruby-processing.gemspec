  Ruby-Processing is a Ruby wrapper for the Processing code art framework. It's 
  this thin little shim that squeezes between Processing and JRuby, passing 
  along some neat goodies like:
  
  * Applet and Application exporting of your sketches. Hand them out to 
    your party guests, ready-to-run.
    
  * Live Coding via JRuby's IRB. Loads in your sketch so you can futz with 
    variables and remake methods on the fly.
    
  * A "Control Panel" library, so that you can easily create sliders, buttons, 
    checkboxes and drop-down menus, and hook them into your sketch's instance 
    variables.
    
  * "Watch" mode, where Ruby-Processing keeps an eye on your sketch and reloads 
    it from scratch every time you make a change. A pretty nice REPL-ish way 
    to work on your Processing sketches.
